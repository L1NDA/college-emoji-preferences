# College Student Emoji Preferences
## An analysis of the Harvard student population and emoji usage

45 Harvard students were surveyed on their most used emojis on their phone, along with basic demographic information. Analyses were conducted on overall emoji prefereces, as well as preferences split by year, house, gender, and state. The network of emojis was also examined and visualized.

This project was completed as part of the Gov1005 final project.
